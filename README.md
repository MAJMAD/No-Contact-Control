The Marble Maze Demo's code

The Marble Maze uses four main codes in order to operate. These codes are HexapodMarble3.py, Sensor_Reading_Final_Fine_Control.ino, Motion.txt, and DEMO_MAC.txt.

These are run from different devices, those devices being a Raspberry Pi 4B, Arduino Micro, and PI C-887 Hexapod Controller. 

The Raspberry Pi 4B runs HexapodMarble3.py, while the Arduino Micro runs Sensor_Reading_Final_Fine Control.ino, and the PI C-887 Hexapod Controller runs DEMO_MAC.txt upon startup and Motion.txt when called from HexapodMarble3.py.
